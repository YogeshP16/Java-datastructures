### What is a Class in Java?

A **class** is like a blueprint or a template for creating objects. Imagine you're building a toy car. 
The blueprint tells you what parts the car needs (wheels, body, color), but it doesn't make the car itself. 
The **class** is like that blueprint, while an **object** is the actual car you build using that blueprint.

### Why is it Used?

We use a class to define what an object will look like and what it can do. Instead of writing the same code over and over, you can create many objects based on one class. This helps organize code and makes it easier to reuse.

### What Does It Do?

A class defines:
- **Properties**: These are like the features of the toy car (e.g., color, size, speed).
- **Methods**: These are like the actions or behaviors of the toy car (e.g., move, stop, honk).

### How It Works?

A class has two main parts:
1. **Fields (Properties)**: These are variables inside the class that hold the values describing the object.
   - Example: In a `Car` class, you could have `color`, `speed`, and `model` as fields.
   
2. **Methods (Behaviors)**: These are functions that define what the object can do.
   - Example: In the `Car` class, a method could be `startEngine()` to start the car or `accelerate()` to make it go faster.

### Example:

```java
class Car {
    // Fields (Properties)
    String color;
    int speed;
    
    // Methods (Behaviors)
    void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("Engine started!");
    }

    void accelerate() {
        System.out.println("Car is speeding up!");
    }
}
```

Here:
- **Class Name**: `Car`
- **Fields**: `color` (color of the car), `speed` (how fast the car is going)
- **Methods**: `startEngine()` and `accelerate()` (things the car can do)

### In Short:
- A **class** is like a set of instructions to create an object.
- It has **properties** (what the object has) and **methods** (what the object can do).
- We use it to avoid repeating the same code, making it easier to manage and modify.

### **What is an Object in Java?**  
An **object** in Java is like a real-world thing. Think of it as a **container** that holds specific information (data) and actions (methods) related to it. For example:  

If you have a toy car, the **details** like its color, size, and type are like the data, and actions like "move" or "stop" are like the methods.

### **What is an Object?**
- **Definition**: An object is a specific instance of a class that contains data (fields) and behavior (methods).  
- **Why It's Used**: Objects allow us to model real-world entities, enabling reusability, scalability, and modularity in code.  
- **What It Does**: Objects encapsulate data and methods, enabling operations specific to that instance.  
- **How It Works**: An object is created in memory at runtime using a class blueprint, and it interacts with other objects by invoking methods.

### **Class vs Object**
| **Class**                              | **Object**                           |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| A blueprint or template for objects.   | A specific instance created using a class. |
| Defines structure and behavior.        | Holds actual data and performs actions. |
| E.g., `Car` class defines model, speed. | E.g., `Car myCar = new Car();` creates an object. |

---

### **Properties of an Object**
1. **State**: Data stored in fields/attributes (e.g., color of a car).  
2. **Behavior**: Methods define actions (e.g., `drive()` for a car).  
3. **Identity**: Each object has a unique reference in memory.

---

### **How to Access Instance Variables?**
- Use the **dot (`.`) operator** to access fields or call methods of an object:  
  ```java
  Car myCar = new Car();
  myCar.color = "Red";  // Access instance variable
  ```

---

### **How to Create Objects?**
1. **Using the `new` Keyword**:  
   ```java
   Car myCar = new Car();  // Creates an object of Car class
   ```

2. **Using Factory Methods** (Optional):  
   Factory methods in design patterns return object instances. Example: `List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();`

---

### **Dynamic Memory Allocation**
- **What It Is**: Objects are stored in the **heap memory** during runtime.  
- **Why It's Important**: Dynamic allocation allows memory to be assigned and freed as needed.  
- **How It Works**: When you create an object, Java allocates space in the heap, and the reference is stored in the stack.  
  ```java
  Car myCar = new Car();  // `myCar` is a reference to heap memory.
  ```
  
---

### **How to Manipulate Objects?**
1. **Access or Modify Fields**:  
   ```java
   myCar.color = "Blue";  // Change the state of the object
   ```
2. **Call Methods**:  
   ```java
   myCar.drive();  // Perform an action using object's behavior
   ```
3. **Object References**: Assign one object reference to another to share data:  
   ```java
   Car anotherCar = myCar;
   ```

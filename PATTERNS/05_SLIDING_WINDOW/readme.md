To identify whether you can apply **sliding window techniques** (fixed or dynamic templates) for **subarray**, **substring**, or **sum problems**.

---

### **1. Sliding Window Patterns in Problems**
#### **A. Fixed-Size Window (Statically Sized Sliding Window)**
- **Clues**:
  - The problem asks for a subarray/substring of a **fixed size**.
  - Examples:
    - Find the **maximum/minimum sum** of a subarray of size  ( k  ).
    - Count the number of subarrays of size  ( k  ) that satisfy a condition.
  - **Key Template**: Keep the window size fixed and slide it by adding one element and removing one element.
  
---

#### **B. Variable-Size Window (Dynamically Sized Sliding Window)**
- **Clues**:
  - The window size needs to adjust dynamically based on conditions.
  - The problem requires:
    1. Minimizing or maximizing the window size.
    2. Checking for specific conditions within the window.
  - Examples:
    - Find the **smallest/longest subarray** with a sum greater than or equal to  ( S  ).
    - Find the **longest substring** with at most  ( k  ) distinct characters.
    - Find the **minimum window substring** containing all characters of another string.
  - **Key Template**: Adjust the window size (expand/shrink) to maintain validity.

### **2. Key Problem Features for Sliding Window**
#### **A. Arrays or Strings: Subarray/Substrings**
- If the problem asks for:
  1. **Contiguous** elements in an array or string.
  2. Optimizing the size of a subarray/substring.
  3. Sums or counts within a range of elements.
  
#### **B. Constraints on the Window:**
- If the problem mentions conditions like:
  1. A **fixed window size** ( (k )).
  2. A **condition** (e.g., sum, distinct elements, repeating characters).
  3. Minimizing or maximizing the **length** of a subarray or substring.

### **3. How to Decide Fixed or Dynamic Window?**
| **Clue in Problem Statement**                                | **Type of Sliding Window** | **Template**                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Subarray/Substring of **fixed size  (k )**                  | Fixed-Size                | Expand and maintain window size =  ( k  ).                                                      |
| Find **maximum/minimum sum** or value for size  (k )        | Fixed-Size                | Add/remove elements to keep the size fixed.                                                     |
| Problem involves a **sum** or **condition** to be satisfied | Dynamic                   | Expand and shrink window based on the sum/condition.                                            |
| Find **longest/smallest subarray/substring** meeting a condition | Dynamic                   | Adjust window size dynamically (expand/shrink).                                                 |
| Problem involves counting **distinct elements**             | Dynamic                   | Use a **HashMap** or **Set** to manage distinct elements in the window.                         |
| Problem requires finding **anagrams** or matching patterns  | Dynamic                   | Expand window, shrink as necessary, and track character counts using arrays or hashmaps.        |

### Fixed, Static, Non shrinkable

```java
public int findMaxWindow(int[] A, int N) {
    int i = 0, j = 0;
    while (j < N) {
        // CODE: use A[j] to update state which might make the window invalid
        if (invalid()) { // Increment the left edge ONLY when the window is invalid. In this way, the window GROWS when it's valid, and SHIFTS when it's invalid
            // CODE: update state using A[i]
            i++;
        }
        // after `++j` in the for loop, this window `[i, j)` of length `j - i` MIGHT be valid.
        j++;
    }
    return j - i; // There must be a maximum window of size `j - i`.
}
```

Explanation:
- The `i` and `j` pointers represent the sliding window's left and right boundaries.
- The window will shift when it becomes invalid by incrementing `i`.
- The `invalid()` method should be replaced with your specific condition to check if the window is invalid.
- The loop will iterate through `j` and adjust `i` whenever necessary.
- The final result is the length of the largest valid window, represented by `j - i`.

Make sure to implement the logic for checking the invalid window condition based on the specific problem you're solving.

### Dynamic, Shrinkable, variable

```java
public int findMaxWindow(int[] A, int N) {
    int i = 0, j = 0, ans = 0;
    while (j < N) {
        // CODE: use A[j] to update state which might make the window invalid
        while (invalid()) { // when invalid, keep shrinking the left edge until it's valid again
            // CODE: update state using A[i]
            i++;
        }
        ans = Math.max(ans, j - i + 1); // the window [i, j] is the maximum window we've found thus far
        j++;
    }
    return ans;
}
```

Explanation:
- `i` and `j` are the two pointers representing the window's left and right boundaries.
- The `invalid()` method should be replaced with a check for when the window becomes invalid (like a sum threshold being exceeded or having too many duplicates).
- The loop will adjust the left pointer (`i`) when the window is invalid.
- `ans` keeps track of the maximum valid window length.

To implement this in your specific problem, replace the `invalid()` condition and update logic to suit the problem you're solving.

### **5. Checklist to Recognize Sliding Window**
1. Does the problem deal with **subarrays** or **substrings**?
2. Are you looking to optimize **window size** or **value** (e.g., sum, count, characters)?
3. Is there a condition on the **elements in the window** (e.g., "sum â‰¥  ( S  )", "contains  ( k  ) distinct characters")?
4. Does the problem involve **contiguous elements**?

If the answer is **yes** to most of these, **sliding window** is likely applicable!

/*
Print Fibonacci series up to n terms
Key concept: Generate a sequence where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers.

Approach:

Initialize the first two terms as 0 and 1.
Loop through n-2 terms, calculating the next term as the sum of the last two terms.
Print each term.
Example:

Input: 5 terms â†’ Output: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3

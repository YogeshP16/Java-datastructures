### **1. Understand the Question**
**Key Points:**
- **What is being asked?**  
  Example: "Find distinct cities" → You need `DISTINCT`.
- **What table(s) are involved?**  
  Example: "Data spans two tables" → You might need `JOIN`.
- **What is the expected output?**  
  Example: "Count of items" → You need `COUNT()`.

### **2. Break Down the Query Needs**
#### **a. Data Selection**
- **Use `SELECT`**: For retrieving columns.
- **Use `WHERE`**: For filtering specific rows based on conditions.

#### **b. Combining Data**
- **Use `JOIN`**: When data spans multiple tables and needs combining.
  - **Inner Join**: Only matching rows.
  - **Left Join**: All rows from the left table and matching rows from the right.
  - **Cross Join**: All combinations of rows.

#### **c. Aggregating Data**
- **Use `COUNT`**: To count rows or values.
- **Use `SUM` / `AVG`**: To calculate totals or averages.
- **Use `GROUP BY`**: To group data for aggregation.
- **Use `HAVING`**: To filter aggregated data.

#### **d. Handling Uniqueness**
- **Use `DISTINCT`**: To eliminate duplicates.
- **Use `UNION`**: To combine results from multiple queries while eliminating duplicates.

#### **e. Aliases**
- **Use `AS`**: To create meaningful names for columns or tables.
  - Example: `SELECT Name AS StudentName`.

#### **f. Sorting and Limiting**
- **Use `ORDER BY`**: To sort results.
- **Use `LIMIT`**: To restrict the number of rows returned.

### **3. Match Patterns in the Question**
#### **a. Single Table**
- If all data is in one table, focus on:
  - **`SELECT`**, **`WHERE`**, **`GROUP BY`**, **`ORDER BY`**.
  - Example: "Find the count of unique names" → Use `COUNT(DISTINCT Name)`.

#### **b. Multiple Tables**
- When combining tables, think:
  - **JOIN**: "Combine data based on common keys."
  - Example: "Find students and their classes" → Use `INNER JOIN`.

#### **c. Aggregations**
- Look for phrases like:
  - "Count," "Total," "Sum," or "Average" → Use aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`.
  - Example: "Count the number of cities" → Use `COUNT(CITY)`.

#### **d. Filters**
- Look for keywords like:
  - "Greater than," "Contains," or "Starts with" → Use `WHERE` or `LIKE`.
  - Example: "Find names starting with 'A'" → Use `WHERE Name LIKE 'A%'`.

### **4. Write Step-by-Step**
1. **Start with `SELECT`**: Identify the columns or aggregates needed.
2. **Identify Filters (`WHERE`)**: Apply conditions to restrict data.
3. **Check for Aggregations (`GROUP BY`)**: Are you summarizing data?
4. **Join Tables if Needed (`JOIN`)**: Is data across multiple tables?
5. **Sort or Limit Results (`ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`)**: Apply final touches.

### **5. Build Intuition**
- **Practice**: Solve as many SQL problems as you can to recognize patterns.
- **Simplify**: Break complex problems into smaller parts.
- **Ask Yourself**:
  - Do I need unique results? → Use `DISTINCT`.
  - Am I counting or summing data? → Use `COUNT` or `SUM`.
  - Is data spread across tables? → Use `JOIN`.
  - Am I grouping data? → Use `GROUP BY`.
